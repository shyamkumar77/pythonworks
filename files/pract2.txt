For beginners to coding, Python is an excellent place to start. A big hurdle for aspiring programmers is the difficult
task of learning a new programming language that might not look anything like what they are used to writing or reading.
But, Python features English syntax and is designed to be easy to learn, making it more accessible to beginners in coding
when compared to many other programming languages. Moreover, as Python is an interpreted programming language, it can be easy
to learn.
